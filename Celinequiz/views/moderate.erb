    <p>You are a moderate environmentalist. Your knowledge about current environmental issues is strong, but there is still so much more to learn! Here are three things you can do to help the environment:</p>
    <ol class="center">
      <li>Donate to food that you were about to throw away to food pantries </li>
      <li>Use compostable straws to reduce plastic waste.</li>
      <li>Eat local! By doing this, you support local farmers in your community!</li>
    </ol>
